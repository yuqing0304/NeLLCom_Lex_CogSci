## Introduction

NeLLCom-Lex can be used to simulate the evolution of lexical meaning within one generation of learners, whereas NeLLCom primarily focused on the emergence of universal word order properties. In NeLLCom-Lex, agents communicate within a simplified referential world using pre-defined lexicons acquired during a supervised learning phase.
More details can be found in our [paper1](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-emnlp.580/) and [paper2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.25674)


## Agent Architecture

Both speaking and listening agents are composed of feedforward neural networks (FNNs), following the common architecture design in referential communication games.


## Installing NeLLCom-Lex

1. Cloning NeLLCom_Lex_CogSci:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:yuqing0304/NeLLCom_Lex_CogSci.git
   cd EGG
   pip install --editable .
   
   cd NeLLCom_Lex_CogSci/EGG/egg/zoo/color_game_up
   ```
4. Then, we can run a game, e.g., the color naming experiments conducted in the paper:
    ```bash
    sbatch run.sh
    ```


## NeLLCom-Lex structure

* `data/` contains the full dataset of the colors and their names that are used in the paper.
* `train.py` contains the actual logic implementation.
* `models.py`, `datasets.py`, and `utils_condition.py` contain the models, datasets, and utility functions.
